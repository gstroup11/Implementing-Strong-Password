# Implementing Strong Password

## Description

This project was solely centered around javascript.  The main purpose of this site is to create a random auto generated password.  With this site you can choose between the characters you want and how long the password should be! You then will recieve a password to use wherever you'd like which is secure.

## How to Use 

The generator is easy to use.  When on the site click the "Generate Password" button under the text box.  You will then be prompted with how many characters you would like in the password.  You can choose between 8 and 128 characters.  After that You can choose between lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers through the alerts.  "OK" will comfirm that you want those characters and "cancel" will say you don't want that specified character. Once you go through all four prompts your password will be generated! Just simply copy and paste the password and use it wherever you'd like.
